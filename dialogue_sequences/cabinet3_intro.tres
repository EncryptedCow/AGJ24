In the land of the forgotten, an ancient scroll will tell the tale of how the King’s village and his people will be invaded by a faction from the northwest of the world. It is up to you to save the kingdom and bring peace to all of the land. Lots of nerds love this game so much, they even cosplay as the characters in the game, and recreate the many stories and tales of Chris’s adventures."
